#You need to connect ADXL345 to your Raspberry Pi via SPI. Note that the I2C connection, which is suggested by ADXL345 documentation, has too low throughput and will not work. The recommended connection scheme:

#ADXL345 pin	RPi pin	RPi pin name
#3V3 (or VCC)	01	3.3V DC power
#GND	06	Ground
#CS	24	GPIO08 (SPI0_CE0_N)
#SDO	21	GPIO09 (SPI0_MISO)
#SDA	19	GPIO10 (SPI0_MOSI)
#SCL	23	GPIO11 (SPI0_SCLK)
#using cat 6 could work here, shielded, protects signal
#Suggested twisted pair order:
#GND+MISO
#3.3V+MOSI
#SCLK+CS

cs_pin:
#   The SPI enable pin for the sensor. This parameter must be provided.
#spi_speed: 5000000
#   The SPI speed (in hz) to use when communicating with the chip.
#   The default is 5000000.
#spi_bus:
#spi_software_sclk_pin:
#spi_software_mosi_pin:
#spi_software_miso_pin:
#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
axes_map: x, y, z
#   The accelerometer axis for each of the printer's X, Y, and Z axes.
#   This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
#   orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
#   example, one could set this to "y, x, z" to swap the X and Y axes.
#   It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
#   direction is reversed (eg, "x, z, -y"). The default is "x, y, z".
rate: 3200
#   Output data rate for ADXL345. ADXL345 supports the following data
#   rates: 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25. Note that it is
#   not recommended to change this rate from the default 3200, and
#   rates below 800 will considerably affect the quality of resonance
#   measurements.
